# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
a=16
b=bin(a)
print(b)
```

## Output
![2 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b3acb91-5a33-4787-8c63-0942cba533eb)



## Result
Thus,the python program to covert  number 16 into its binary representation using built-in Python functions is executed successfully.
