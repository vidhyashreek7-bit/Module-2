# ðŸ”º Looping(Patterns)-Pascal's Triangle Generator in Python

This project demonstrates a simple Python program to generate **Pascalâ€™s Triangle**, where the number of rows is provided by the user.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program that generates **Pascal's Triangle** using numbers. The number of rows is accepted from the user.

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Input the number of rows from the user.
3. Loop from 0 to the number of rows.
4. For each row:
   - Print appropriate spaces to shape the triangle.
   - Compute values using the formula:  
     \[
     C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
     \]
5. Print all rows of Pascalâ€™s Triangle.
6. End the program.

---

## ðŸ§ª Program
```
import math
n=7
for i in range(n):
    for s in range(n-i-1):
        print(" ",end="")
    for j in range(i+1):
         print(math.comb(i,j),end=" ")
    print()
```

## Sample Output
<img width="873" height="763" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a3dc316-5137-4786-bdd4-90a8fa48d650" />


## Result
Thus the Python program that generates Pascal's Triangle using numbers is executed successfully.
